# Weather App

A simple weather app in SwiftUI.
Shows weather forecast for current location alongside other cities.




## Support

It's just a test project, I'm gonna keep updating it haha.

## Configuration

To run this project, you will need to add a valid API Key for one of the weather services available. 
Currently, only OpenWeatherMap is supported.

You can change and add cities in the configuration file.

## Roadmap

Some enhancements still in TO-DO due to time constraints:

- Additional weather services support

- More Unit Testing coverage

- Improve dependency injection

- Improvement of UI/UX

- Show additional data.

- Configuration can be downloaded remotely (IE: Firebase Remote Config)

- Improvement on Animations

- Enhancements in subcomponents, better use of SwiftUI and Combine.

- If possible, update the minimum iOS version in order to use newer features like async/await

- Implement other architectures with SwiftUI as an excersice. 

- MVVM can be simplified with deeper understanding of SwiftUI and Combine.

- Support for different langugaes
